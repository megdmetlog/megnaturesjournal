                        After Ma'am Grace briefly introduced herself, we had our first General Biology 
                        lesson on the characteristics of life. A part of the lesson was talking about how, 
                        at first glance, it may seem like there are no similarities between living and non-living 
                        things. But then, I learned that there are more similarities between us in a biological level. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much like the electric fan, which can appear to lack at least one aspect of life, 
                        yet requires order in its structure to perform properly. Today I learned a lot. 
                        Some of it includes that an individual with Down syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead 
                        of the standard 46 chromosomes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trisomy happens when the 21st chromosome comes along with an extra chromosome.  
                        Though we didn't discuss this during our discussion, I conducted my research and found that the reason cancer 
                        cells exist is due to the gene mutation changing some of the genes in the DNA of the cell. 
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="column">
                    <div class="outside"></div>
                    <p>
                        These mutations can be those affecting genes influencing cellular proliferation, 
                        leading to loss of control by normal cells in their cell division and growth processes 
                        and thus forming cancerous cells. But what I learned today is that apparently, viruses 
                        are still in question whether they are living organisms or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another is that, unlike humans, plants have cell walls, which protect them from diseases 
                        but also impair their ability to move. Ma'am Grace also emphasized that edema, or swelling 
                        in the extremities, is an indication of kidney failure, which is one of the most common causes of death in the Philippines. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If when you press on your skin, it doesn't spring back, you might have edema. In such a short session, 
                        I learned so many things, and trying to absorb so much information sparked back my curiosity and interest 
                        in the subject again. It was a fantastic day.
