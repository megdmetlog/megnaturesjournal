                    Since our classroom was under construction, We had to move to a room called Think Tank which is located just beside our old classroom. The room had a large, round table at its center, surrounded by plush, oversized chairs that gave off the vibe of a senator’s chamber. In addition to this, the room has an automated sliding door, which adds to the futuristic yet powerful atmosphere. I’m hoping that we’ll get another chance to stay in that room since it was such a memorable and unique experience. In general biology, We talked about the Cytoskeleton system. One of the most memorable parts of the lesson was when Ma’am Grace clarified that there are instances in which eukaryotes are unicellular.

                    Another one is that bacteria are surrounded by a mesh-like layer called peptidoglycan which could either be motile or non-motile. Bacteria surrounded by motile peptidoglycan are what cause communicable disease while bacteria surrounded by non-motile peptidoglycan are what cause non-communicable disease. This took us quite some time to answer but turns out that prokaryotes still need protein because it’s responsible for the formation of the DNA. We also played a game where we will find a suitable habitat for the given organisms although it was more challenging than I expected since I don’t know much about the microorganisms, it was still enjoyable though. Today felt like a long day.
