                    Today our class took place in the Innotech in front of the Biyo lab located in the Scire Building. 
                    We had a double period which allowed Ma’am Grace to finish discussing three lessons, well, only 2 because Ma’am Grace ended up telling us a story instead.

                    In the Cell Theory, Hans and Zacharias Janssen invented the microscope, but they were not recognized as the "Father of Microscopy" because of the Janssen family's association with fraud, which made some doubt his sincerity. 
                    I felt sorry for him because, despite the lack of concrete evidence against him, he was still viewed with suspicion by many.

                    Another is that Rudolf Virchow stole Robert Remak's idea. However, even though Remak was the proponent of the idea of "Omnis cellula e cellula," Virchow is the one who is consistently given credit for the idea even if he wasn't the first to propose the idea.  
                    Remak still doesn't get credit for it since he failed to patent his creation, making it possible for others to steal it.

                    This wasn’t during the discussion but later in the day, I watched Sir Jaxx’s lecture about the parts of the Cell. 
                    I came to realize how easy general biology becomes when you start to connect the processes of each component with real life. 
                    It also adds to the fun! The way that cells produce proteins can be compared to an online delivery system. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When a person places an online order, the protein is produced in the nucleolus and then quality-checked (via the rough ER). 
                    Eventually, it passes through the smooth ER to be packed into trucks, or vacuoles, that are used to transfer proteins out of the cell membrane.
