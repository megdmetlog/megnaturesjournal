                    Today, we had our second Colloquium class for general biology in the Magis Hall. 
                    Unfortunately due to conflicts with schedule, 
                    Sir Jaxx was not available then.
                  </p>
                  <p>
        
                    He did leave with a pre-recorded lesson video, but unfortunately, The volume was not loud enough for all of us to hear. 
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <div class="outside"></div>
                  <p>
                    In addition, we all had difficulty seeing the screen in front of us because we were placed at the very back of the Magis Hall. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fortunately, we were provided with the pre-recorded video of the lesson for us to watch again and understand better.
