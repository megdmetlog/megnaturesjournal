                    We had our first laboratory exercise today. I learned about the parts of the microscope 
                    and how they all work together. I learned to hold the arm of the microscope in my dominant hand 
                    and the base with my non-dominant hand.

                    There are three types of microscopes: the monocular, the compound, which has a source of light, 
                    and the electron, which is too expensive that's why we do not have in our laboratory. 
                    Prior to our lab activity, I had the impression that using the microscope was simpler than it actually was.

                    After our lab activity, We had our colloquium in the Magis Hall.

                    At first, there were problems, such as not having enough chairs for everyone, but, thankfully, these were resolved immediately. 
                    Sir Jaxx discussed about the theory of spontaneous generation which is long outdated. It postulated that living things can develop 
                    from inanimate ones.

                    If you think about it, it is kind of silly. But that's only because, we had a different understanding back then compared to now, 
                    thanks to those who were part of the Spontaneous Generation.
