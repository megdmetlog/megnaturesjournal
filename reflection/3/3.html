                    Today was our second time going to the Laboratory. 
                    We were able to finish our Space Lab 2 this time because we had significantly more time than last time. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We were able to observe the following prepared slides: Escherichia coli, Nostoc, Euglena, Paramecium, Penicillium, 
                    Rotifer under the microscope.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <div class="outside"></div>
                  <p>
                    The Escherichia coli (E-coli) looked like sprinkles like the ones you can find in cupcakes. Nostoc looks like a tiny chain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Euglena reminded me of the shape of green beans or a tiny leaf. The Paramecium was my favorite, they are small and color. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Penicillium is blue and had like tiny branches of a tree in it. And the rotifer looked like a weird variant of a squid or some sort of parasite.
                    I find it fascinating how we are built of such tiny, complex cells.
